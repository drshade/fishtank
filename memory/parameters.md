# Water Parameters

## Targets (Neocaridina, this tank)

| Parameter | Target | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GH | 6-8 | General hardness |
| KH | 2-4 | Carbonate hardness; aquasoil tends to pull this down |
| TDS | 150-250 ppm | Total dissolved solids |
| pH | Stable > exact | Aquasoil lowers pH; consistency matters more than the number |
| Temperature | 22-24°C | Neos tolerate 18-25°C; aim mid-range |

## Measurements

Full append-only log: [`data/measurements.csv`](../data/measurements.csv)
(`date,tds_ppm,gh,kh,ph,temp_c,notes`). New reading → append a CSV row,
then refresh the latest-reading line below.

**Latest**: 2026-05-26 — temp ~26°C (uncalibrated mercury thermometer,
suspected to read high → real maybe 24-25; constancy-tracking, not
absolute). No TDS/GH/KH readings yet — pen and test kits ordered, see
`pending.md`.

_Calibration: to trust absolute temp, dunk the thermometer in well-stirred
ice water (= 0°C exactly) and note the offset; subtract it from tank
readings._

## Remineralisation

- Remineralise top-off water once the GH/KH+ arrives (ordered — see
  `pending.md` for product and ETA). Rationale: `knowledge.md`
  ("Water source").

## Water change protocol (current — babies present)

- **Volume**: 10-15% (~2L for ~17L water)
- **Refill**: slow drip / gentle stream over 5-10 min
- **Temperature**: match within 1°C
- **Parameters**: match TDS/GH where possible (mix new water to same
  recipe as tank)
- **Frequency**: light weekly maintenance OK; avoid for 2-3 weeks after
  any new brood release
- **Carpet siphoning**: do not penetrate hairgrass while babies are
  small. Surface siphon only (hover above carpet, stir gently from
  above with chopstick, suck up suspended particles). Always inspect
  siphon output in a clear container for 10 min before disposing —
  catch any accidental shrimplet pickups.

## TDS / GH dynamics in shrimp tanks

- TDS climbing = minerals accumulating from food + tap top-offs →
  water change due
- TDS dropping = shrimp eating minerals via molts faster than replaced
  → remineralise top-off water
- More shrimp = more molts = faster GH depletion

## Evaporation top-up

- With lid off + surface agitation, expect ~0.5-1L/week loss
- Top up every few days, don't let water drop more than ~1cm (else
  TDS/minerals concentrate)
- **Plain Amsterdam tap is fine — no dechlorinator needed** (NL/Waternet
  distributes chlorine- and chloramine-free water by national policy).
  Run the cold tap until properly cold first to flush copper/metals from
  pipes (neos are copper-sensitive). Or use remineralised RO. Match temp
  within 1°C either way. See `knowledge.md` "Water source".
